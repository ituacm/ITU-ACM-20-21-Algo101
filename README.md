# ITU ACM 2020-2021 Algo101 Course

### Prerequisities
 - Basic knowledge about any programming language, preferably C/C++.
 - Having an account on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
 - Zoom account.
 - Attendee's own programming environment installed.

### Goal

Participants will learn to solve the problems that we encounter in daily life or writing efficient code starting from the basic algorithm information. Competitive Programming will be introduced and we will have the opportunity to apply our knowledge after adapting what we have learned to the question types with the contests related to each week's topic.
